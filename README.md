Note: The datasets used for this study are available from the European Butterfly Monitor Scheme via a signed license agreement (https://butterfly-monitoring.net/). The dataset generated for the analyses of the study is available via Zenodo at 10.5281/zenodo.15012265. Climatic data are available via ECAD website (https://www.ecad.eu/).

Note: The code includes the general template code to be used for the analyses. It does not include all steps of model selection and model per species category, or the conservative approaches done (as they are the same).
The code to calculate the index of abundances is available at: https://github.com/RetoSchmucki/rbms
